                                <p>ENT stands for Ear, Nose and Throat.  ENT is technically known as Otolaryngology, which is the diagnosis and treatment of ailments affecting oneâ€™s head and neck, including the ear, nose and throat.  ENT procedures at Iowa City Ambulatory Surgery Center (Iowa City ASC) are performed on adults and children.</p>
                                <p>A dietitian, medical dietitian, or dietician[1] is an expert in identifying and treating disease-related malnutrition and in conducting medical nutrition therapy, for example designing an enteral tube feeding regimen or mitigating the effects of cancer cachexia. Many dietitians work in hospitals and usually see specific patients where a nutritional assessment and intervention has been requested by a doctor or nurse, for example if a patient has lost their ability to swallow or requires artificial nutrition due to intestinal failure.</p>
